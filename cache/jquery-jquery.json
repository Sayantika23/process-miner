one.\r\nIn cases where that's not possible as we need to match an external API, there's\r\nan escape hatch of prefixing an unused argument with `_`.\r\n\r\nThis change makes it easier to catch unused AMD dependencies and unused\r\nparameters in internal functions the API of which we may change at will, among\r\nother things.\r\n\r\nUnused AMD dependencies have been removed as part of this

This occurs when an element is removed when it loses focus, during a focusout handler, responding to a jQuery triggered blur() event. The three key operations are all performed via jQuery: $(element).blur(), $(element).on(\"focusout\"), $(element).remove(). \r\n\r\nThe exception occurs on line 5467; here is the code up to that line:\r\n\r\n\t\t\t\t\tdataPriv.set( this, type, saved );\r\n\r\n\t\t\t\t\t// Trigger the native event and capture its result\r\n\t\t\t\t\t// Support: IE <=9 - 11+\r\n\t\t\t\t\t// focus() and blur() are asynchronous\r\n\t\t\t\t\tnotAsync = expectSync( this, type );\r\n\t\t\t\t\tthis[ type ]();\r\n\t\t\t\t\tresult = dataPriv.get( this, type );\r\n\t\t\t\t\tif ( saved !== result || notAsync ) {\r\n\t\t\t\t\t\tdataPriv.set( this, type, false );\r\n\t\t\t\t\t} else {\r\n\t\t\t\t\t\tresult = {};\r\n\t\t\t\t\t}\r\n\t\t\t\t\tif ( saved !== result ) {\r\n\r\n\t\t\t\t\t\t// Cancel the outer synthetic event\r\n\t\t\t\t\t\tevent.stopImmediatePropagation();\r\n\t\t\t\t\t\tevent.preventDefault();\r\n\t\t\t\t\t\treturn result.value;\r\n\t\t\t\t\t}\r\n\r\nIn the last line, result is undefined. That is because during this[ type ]() (which issues the event), the element is removed, causing jQuery to remove its saved information from dataPriv in cleanData() line 6046:\r\n\t\t\t\t\telem[ dataPriv.expando ] = undefined;\r\n\r\nThus, after this[ type ](), result is undefined, it does not equal saved, so the dataPriv.set() of the conditional is executed and result is left undefined. Presumably, result = () needs to be set outside the conditional. This problem is also timing-sensitive -- with the certain break points it may not occur.\r\n\r\nThis didn't happen in 3.3.1. Note also that jQuery's blur() must be used, rather than normal JS blur(), in order to go through this code path.\r\n\r\n### Link to test case ###\r\njsfiddle uses 3.3.1, so I didn't set up a test case.\r\n"},{"url":"https://api.github.com/repos/jquery/jquery/issues/4409","repository_url":"https://api.github.com/repos/jquery/jquery","labels_url":"https://api.github.com/repos/jquery/jquery/issues/4409/labels{/name}","comments_url":"https://api.github.com/repos/jquery/jquery/issues/4409/comments","events_url":"https://api.github.com/repos/jquery/jquery/issues/4409/events","html_url":"https://github.com/jquery/jquery/issues/4409","id":448964638,"node_id":"MDU6SXNzdWU0NDg5NjQ2Mzg=","number":4409,"title":"Have Trusted Types API built directly into the jQuery Core Files","user":{"login":"ayumihamsaki","id":17784082,"node_id":"MDQ6VXNlcjE3Nzg0MDgy","avatar_url":"https://avatars2.githubusercontent.com/u/17784082?v=4","gravatar_id":"","url":"https://api.github.com/users/ayumihamsaki","html_url":"https://github.com/ayumihamsaki","followers_url":"https://api.github.com/users/ayumihamsaki/followers","following_url":"https://api.github.com/users/ayumihamsaki/following{/other_user}","gists_url":"https://api.github.com/users/ayumihamsaki/gists{/gist_id}","starred_url":"https://api.github.com/users/ayumihamsaki/starred{/owner}{/repo}","subscriptions_url":"https://api.github.com/users/ayumihamsaki/subscriptions","organizations_url":"https://api.github.com/users/ayumihamsaki/orgs","repos_url":"https://api.github.com/users/ayumihamsaki/repos","events_url":"https://api.github.com/users/ayumihamsaki/events{/privacy}","received_events_url":"https://api.github.com/users/ayumihamsaki/received_events","type":"User","site_admin":false},"labels":[],"state":"open","locked":false,"assignee":null,"assignees":[],"milestone":{"url":"https://api.github.com/repos/jquery/jquery/milestones/7","html_url":"https://github.com/jquery/jquery/milestone/7","labels_url":"https://api.github.com/repos/jquery/jquery/milestones/7/labels","id":1258672,"node_id":"MDk6TWlsZXN0b25lMTI1ODY3Mg==","number":7,"title":"4.0.0","description":"","creator":{"login":"mgol","id":1758366,"node_id":"MDQ6VXNlcjE3NTgzNjY=","avatar_url":"https://avatars0.githubusercontent.com/u/1758366?v=4","gravatar_id":"","url":"https://api.github.com/users/mgol","html_url":"https://github.com/mgol","followers_url":"https://api.github.com/users/mgol/followers","following_url":"https://api.github.com/users/mgol/following{/other_user}","gists_url":"https://api.github.com/users/mgol/gists{/gist_id}","starred_url":"https://api.github.com/users/mgol/starred{/owner}{/repo}","subscriptions_url":"https://api.github.com/users/mgol/subscriptions","organizations_url":"https://api.github.com/users/mgol/orgs","repos_url":"https://api.github.com/users/mgol/repos","events_url":"https://api.github.com/users/mgol/events{/privacy}","received_events_url":"https://api.github.com/users/mgol/received_events","type":"User","site_admin":false},"open_issues":45,"closed_issues":20,"state":"open","created_at":"2015-08-17T16:45:34Z","updated_at":"2019-06-26T19:39:11Z","due_on":null,"closed_at":null},"comments":6,"created_at":"2019-05-27T18:52:00Z","updated_at":"2019-06-10T15:51:08Z","closed_at":null,"author_association":"NONE","body":"The latest version of jQuery V3.4.1 has 5 `innerHTML()` which are not sanitized by default.

The first commit inlines Sizzle mostly as-is, the subsequent commit fixes ESLint violations; later commits mostly remove workarounds for old browsers.\r\n\r\nCurrently the PR reduces the gzipped jQuery size by `1201` bytes compared to `master`.\r\n\r\nI'm opening it as a draft as I still need to backport Sizzle tests. It's ready for initial review, though (reviewing by commit might be easier).\r\n\r\nI've checked that all the tests pass in Chrome 74 & IE 11. All Sizzle tests are also passing for `jQuery.find` except for the `Sizzle.noConflict` one - but `jQuery.find` has always stripped `noConflict` out of its internal Sizzle version.\r\n\r\n### Checklist ###\r\n<!--\r\nMark an `[x]` for completed items, if you're not sure leave them unchecked and we can assist.\r\n-->\r\n\r\n* [x] All authors have signed the CLA at https://cla.js.foundation/jquery/jquery\r\n* [ ] New tests have been added to show the fix or feature works (TODO: port all Sizzle tests)\r\n* [x] Grunt build and unit tests pass locally with these changes\r\n* ~~If needed, a docs issue/PR was created at https://github.com/jquery/api.jquery.com~~\r\n\r\n<!--\r\nThanks!

This change ended up being reverted in 3.1.0.\r\nhttps://github.com/jquery/jquery/issues/3193\r\nOne of the reason it was reverted was that it broke the symmetry of the API.\r\n\r\nThen in 3.2.0 the width and height functions were changed to return the width/height without scrollbars (clientWidth/clientHeight). This too has broken the symmetry of the API:\r\nhttps://jsfiddle.net/JoolsCaesar/r0vxq926/\r\nNote: I'm seeing this behaviour in Chrome, IE, Edge and Opera but not Firefox\r\n\r\nIs this a bug? \r\nIf it's an intentional change it might be worth adding something to the documentation as there's no mention of scrollbars in the width and height API and people might assume that these function still work as symmetric getters and setters. It also seems a little odd that this is no longer consistent across browsers.\r\n\r\nIs there a way to get the old value?\r\nPreviously I would call $elem.width() if I wanted the width ignoring scrollbars and $elem[0].clientWidth to get the width taking scrollbars into account. Now they both do the same thing and I'd like to know how to get at the former. \r\n\r\nAlso the API (http://api.jquery.com/width/) states:\r\n\r\n> Note that .width() will always return the content width, regardless of the value of the CSS box-sizing property.\r\n\r\nThat doesn't seem to be true, because setting box-sizing to border-box causes it to ignore the scrollbars, essentially reverting to the old behaviour:\r\nhttps://jsfiddle.net/JoolsCaesar/r0vxq926/5/\r\n\r\n### Link to test case ###\r\nNew asymmetric API:\r\nhttps://jsfiddle.net/JoolsCaesar/r0vxq926/\r\nOld behaviour (jQuery 3.1.1):\r\nhttps://jsfiddle.net/JoolsCaesar/r0vxq926/1\r\n"},{"url":"https://api.github.com/repos/jquery/jquery/issues/4250","repository_url":"https://api.github.com/repos/jquery/jquery","labels_url":"https://api.github.com/repos/jquery/jquery/issues/4250/labels{/name}","comments_url":"https://api.github.com/repos/jquery/jquery/issues/4250/comments","events_url":"https://api.github.com/repos/jquery/jquery/issues/4250/events","html_url":"https://github.com/jquery/jquery/issues/4250","id":386926919,"node_id":"MDU6SXNzdWUzODY5MjY5MTk=","number":4250,"title":"jQuery.ajax: make `dataType: \"script\"` not execute scripts on unsuccessful HTTP status","user":{"login":"mgol","id":1758366,"node_id":"MDQ6VXNlcjE3NTgzNjY=","avatar_url":"https://avatars0.githubusercontent.com/u/1758366?v=4","gravatar_id":"","url":"https://api.github.com/users/mgol","html_url":"https://github.com/mgol","followers_url":"https://api.github.com/users/mgol/followers","following_url":"https://api.github.com/users/mgol/following{/other_user}","gists_url":"https://api.github.com/users/mgol/gists{/gist_id}","starred_url":"https://api.github.com/users/mgol/starred{/owner}{/repo}","subscriptions_url":"https://api.github.com/users/mgol/subscriptions","organizations_url":"https://api.github.com/users/mgol/orgs","repos_url":"https://api.github.com/users/mgol/repos","events_url":"https://api.github.com/users/mgol/events{/privacy}","received_events_url":"https://api.github.com/users/mgol/received_events","type":"User","site_admin":false},"labels":[{"id":143821075,"node_id":"MDU6TGFiZWwxNDM4MjEwNzU=","url":"https://api.github.com/repos/jquery/jquery/labels/Ajax","name":"Ajax","color":"0052cc","default":false},{"id":153918056,"node_id":"MDU6TGFiZWwxNTM5MTgwNTY=","url":"https://api.github.com/repos/jquery/jquery/labels/Behavior%20Change","name":"Behavior Change","color":"ff4400","default":false}],"state":"open","locked":false,"assignee":null,"assignees":[],"milestone":{"url":"https://api.github.com/repos/jquery/jquery/milestones/7","html_url":"https://github.com/jquery/jquery/milestone/7","labels_url":"https://api.github.com/repos/jquery/jquery/milestones/7/labels","id":1258672,"node_id":"MDk6TWlsZXN0b25lMTI1ODY3Mg==","number":7,"title":"4.0.0","description":"","creator":{"login":"mgol","id":1758366,"node_id":"MDQ6VXNlcjE3NTgzNjY=","avatar_url":"https://avatars0.githubusercontent.com/u/1758366?v=4","gravatar_id":"","url":"https://api.github.com/users/mgol","html_url":"https://github.com/mgol","followers_url":"https://api.github.com/users/mgol/followers","following_url":"https://api.github.com/users/mgol/following{/other_user}","gists_url":"https://api.github.com/users/mgol/gists{/gist_id}","starred_url":"https://api.github.com/users/mgol/starred{/owner}{/repo}","subscriptions_url":"https://api.github.com/users/mgol/subscriptions","organizations_url":"https://api.github.com/users/mgol/orgs","repos_url":"https://api.github.com/users/mgol/repos","events_url":"https://api.github.com/users/mgol/events{/privacy}","received_events_url":"https://api.github.com/users/mgol/received_events","type":"User","site_admin":false},"open_issues":45,"closed_issues":20,"state":"open","created_at":"2015-08-17T16:45:34Z","updated_at":"2019-06-26T19:39:11Z","due_on":null,"closed_at":null},"comments":4,"created_at":"2018-12-03T17:34:53Z","updated_at":"2019-04-27T14:49:57Z","closed_at":null,"author_association":"MEMBER","body":"<!--\r\nFeature Requests:\r\n  Please read https://github.com/jquery/jquery/wiki/Adding-new-features\r\n  Most features should start as plugins outside of jQuery.\r\n\r\nBug Reports:\r\n  Note that we only can fix bugs in the latest version of jQuery.\r\n  Briefly describe the issue you've encountered\r\n  *  What do you expect to happen?\r\n  *  What actually happens?\r\n  *  Which browsers are affected?\r\n  Provide a *minimal* test case, see https://webkit.org/test-case-reduction/\r\n  Use the latest shipping version of jQuery in your test case!\r\n  We prefer test cases on https://jsbin.com or https://jsfiddle.net\r\n\r\nFrequently Reported Issues:\r\n  * Selectors with '#' break: See https://github.com/jquery/jquery/issues/2824\r\n-->\r\n\r\n### Description ###\r\n\r\nA followup of PR #4243 and an extension of issue #4126.

handling tries to keep boolean attribute values valid according to the spec, by always setting the lowercased attribute name regardless of what value was set. However, we do this for all elements whether the boolean attribute is valid on that element or not. This is especially troublesome for custom elements.\r\n\r\nRather than checking the nodeName of the element to ensure the boolean attribute applies to that element, it may be doable to just allow any string through. It may not be technically valid, but I think it works in all browsers to set any string. We'd still want to keep the special handling for the value `false` (i.e. remove the attribute rather than set `\"false\"`, which is actually `true`). Note that the string `\"false\"` would still be passed through.\r\n\r\n### Link to test case ###\r\n\r\nSee https://github.com/angular/angular.js/issues/16602#issuecomment-397794145 for

It would be simpler if we used a private value for the interval value (basically just hard-code the default `13`) so that *any* use of `jQuery.fx.interval` could be indentified as deprecated. There is a slight risk that someone might be changing that value but it seems unlikely since we are already ignoring it except for two rare-ish cases: 1) IE9 always, 2) browsers when the document is hidden.\r\n\r\nIn addition, per some discussion on https://github.com/jquery/jquery-migrate/pull/298 we may want to change from `document.hidden` to `document.visibilityState` since the standard has changed.

You can also use a nonce or a hash (see below), but **you really shouldn't**. **Banning inline script is the biggest security win CSP provides**, and banning inline style likewise hardens your application.\r\n\r\n> you can enable them by adding 'unsafe-eval' as an allowed source in a script-src directive, but **we strongly discourage this**.\r\n\r\nSo I hope you will consider changing the current behavior for the sake of a safer web (taking into account how widespread your library is)."},{"url":"https://api.github.com/repos/jquery/jquery/issues/3902","repository_url":"https://api.github.com/repos/jquery/jquery","labels_url":"https://api.github.com/repos/jquery/jquery/issues/3902/labels{/name}","comments_url":"https://api.github.com/repos/jquery/jquery/issues/3902/comments","events_url":"https://api.github.com/repos/jquery/jquery/issues/3902/events","html_url":"https://github.com/jquery/jquery/pull/3902","id":284140998,"node_id":"MDExOlB1bGxSZXF1ZXN0MTU5ODUwNTkw","number":3902,"title":"Ajax: Create correct URLs for jQuery.ajax() with cache: false","user":{"login":"wenz","id":147852,"node_id":"MDQ6VXNlcjE0Nzg1Mg==","avatar_url":"https://avatars0.githubusercontent.com/u/147852?v=4","gravatar_id":"","url":"https://api.github.com/users/wenz","html_url":"https://github.com/wenz","followers_url":"https://api.github.com/users/wenz/followers","following_url":"https://api.github.com/users/wenz/following{/other_user}","gists_url":"https://api.github.com/users/wenz/gists{/gist_id}","starred_url":"https://api.github.com/users/wenz/starred{/owner}{/repo}","subscriptions_url":"https://api.github.com/users/wenz/subscriptions","organizations_url":"https://api.github.com/users/wenz/orgs","repos_url":"https://api.github.com/users/wenz/repos","events_url":"https://api.github.com/users/wenz/events{/privacy}","received_events_url":"https://api.github.com/users/wenz/received_events","type":"User","site_admin":false},"labels":[],"state":"open","locked":false,"assignee":null,"assignees":[],"milestone":{"url":"https://api.github.com/repos/jquery/jquery/milestones/7","html_url":"https://github.com/jquery/jquery/milestone/7","labels_url":"https://api.github.com/repos/jquery/jquery/milestones/7/labels","id":1258672,"node_id":"MDk6TWlsZXN0b25lMTI1ODY3Mg==","number":7,"title":"4.0.0","description":"","creator":{"login":"mgol","id":1758366,"node_id":"MDQ6VXNlcjE3NTgzNjY=","avatar_url":"https://avatars0.githubusercontent.com/u/1758366?v=4","gravatar_id":"","url":"https://api.github.com/users/mgol","html_url":"https://github.com/mgol","followers_url":"https://api.github.com/users/mgol/followers","following_url":"https://api.github.com/users/mgol/following{/other_user}","gists_url":"https://api.github.com/users/mgol/gists{/gist_id}","starred_url":"https://api.github.com/users/mgol/starred{/owner}{/repo}","subscriptions_url":"https://api.github.com/users/mgol/subscriptions","organizations_url":"https://api.github.com/users/mgol/orgs","repos_url":"https://api.github.com/users/mgol/repos","events_url":"https://api.github.com/users/mgol/events{/privacy}","received_events_url":"https://api.github.com/users/mgol/received_events","type":"User","site_admin":false},"open_issues":45,"closed_issues":20,"state":"open","created_at":"2015-08-17T16:45:34Z","updated_at":"2019-06-26T19:39:11Z","due_on":null,"closed_at":null},"comments":6,"created_at":"2017-12-22T11:31:09Z","updated_at":"2019-04-08T17:45:21Z","closed_at":null,"author_association":"NONE","pull_request":{"url":"https://api.github.com/repos/jquery/jquery/pulls/3902","html_url":"https://github.com/jquery/jquery/pull/3902","diff_url":"https://github.com/jquery/jquery/pull/3902.diff","patch_url":"https://github.com/jquery/jquery/pull/3902.patch"},"body":"fixes gh-3682\r\n\r\n### Summary ###\r\nCorrectly creates the URL for calls to jQuery.ajax() when the \"cache\" option is set to false.

Description ###\r\nWhen using the delegated version of `$parent.on(events, selector, handler)` with `events` being a MouseEvent, the event is not recognized in IE11 and Edge (and possibly in other IE flavors either), if the `.target` of the event is an SVG `<use>` element pointing to an externally defined symbol.\r\n\r\n    <svg><defs><rect id=\"sym\"...></defs></svg>\r\n    <p><use xlink:href=\"#sym\"/></svg></p>\r\n\r\n    $(document).on('click', 'p', handler); // This will not work\r\n\r\nThe event is recognized if the reference SVG symbol (pointed by the `<use>`'s `xlink:href` attribute) is itself declared inside the delegation target pointed by `selector`, e.g in above example if the first `<svg>` element were in the targeted `<p>`, it would work.   \r\n\r\nIt will also work if the event is not delegated, e.g with the first HTML structure, `$('p').on('click', handler)` will work.\r\n\r\nI believe this is because IE does set the target of such event to a weird `SVGElementInstance`, probably representing the shadow-element `<use>` element uses.  \r\nI don't know IE that much and it's the first time I encounter this weird object, which I don't think is
