incorrect namespace for root node created through ViewContainerRef (#31232)\n\nCurrently in Ivy whenever we encounter a new namespace, we set it in the global state so that all subsequent nodes are created under the same namespace. Next time a template is run the namespace will be reset back to HTML.\n\nThis breaks down if the last node that was rendered was under the SVG or MathML namespace and we create a component through `ViewContainerRef.create`, because the next template function hasn't run yet and it hasn't had the chance to update the namespace. The result is that the root node of the new component will retain the wrong namespace and may not end up rendering at all (e.g. if we're trying to show a `div` inside the SVG namespace). This issue has the potential to affect a lot of apps, because all components inserted through the router also go through `ViewContainerRef.create`.\n\nPR Close

`gulp-clang-format` to 1.0.23 (#31295)\n\nThe `gulp format*` tasks have been broken since 5eb742621. These include\nthe `gulp format:enforce` task, which is what runs on CI to enforce\nconsistent code style. Here is what (I believe) happened:\n\n- I assume formatting was failing in 5eb742621 (moving `zone.js` into\n  `angular/angular`). The reason must have been that\n  [this glob pattern][1] matches `packages/zone.js/` (which is a\n  directory) and passes it to `clang-format` claiming it is a file.\n- I further assume that in an attempt to fix the issue,\n  `gulp-clang-format` was updated to the latest version (1.0.27) in\n  5eb742621.\n- `gulp format:enforce` stopped complaining, so everyone thought\n  formatting was fine and moved on.\n- Formatting still wasn't fine, but the task completed successfully\n  nevertheless :scream:\n- The reason is that angular/gulp-clang-format@55b697c5c (and subsequent\n  commits) changed the way the `done()` callback was called, leaving it\n  to `clang-format` to call it (while previously it was also called when\n  the associated stream ended).\n- In the old version of `clang-format` that we are using (1.0.41), there\n  is a bug (which has been fixed in angular/clang-format@4cce2c4ee):\n  The callback is not called\n  [unless the process exits with an error][2].\n\nOne can also see that the `gulp format:enforce` task is not completed in\n`gulp lint`. Example output from [build 374722][3]:\n\n```\nyarn gulp lint\n...\nStarting 'format:enforce'...\nStarting 'validate-commit-messages'...\n...\nFinished 'validate-commit-messages' after 833 ms\nStarting 'tools:build'...\nFinished 'tools:build' after 1.75 s\nStarting 'tslint'...\nFinished 'tslint' after 19 s\nDone in 21.82s.\n```\n\nNotice that all tasks have a corresponding \"Finished X` log, except for\n`format:enforce`.\n\nFor reference:\nThe problem was originally reported by @ocombe on Slack ([discussion][4]).\n\n---\nThis commit fixes the issue by downgrading `gulp-clang-format` to\n1.0.23. The linting failures due to formatting issues will be addressed\nin subsequent commits.\n\n[1]: https://github.com/angular/angular/blob/a8f3b317f/tools/gulp-tasks/format.js#L13\n[2]: https://github.com/angular/clang-format/blob/b8c7df0b7/index.js#L95\n[3]: https://circleci.com/gh/angular/angular/374722\n[4]: https://angular-team.slack.com/archives/C042EU9T5/p1561480241191000\n\nPR Close #31295","tree":{"sha":"2f984cb63f93a8b88a9a6e21097b9ac42865b86c","url":"https://api.github.com/repos/angular/angular/git/trees/2f984cb63f93a8b88a9a6e21097b9ac42865b86c"},"url":"https://api.github.com/repos/angular/angular/git/commits/850390174677216eb9c85120b1e44386421f53ed","comment_count":0,"verification":{"verified":false,"reason":"unsigned","signature":null,"payload":null}},"url":"https://api.github.com/repos/angular/angular/commits/850390174677216eb9c85120b1e44386421f53ed","html_url":"https://github.com/angular/angular/commit/850390174677216eb9c85120b1e44386421f53ed","comments_url":"https://api.github.com/repos/angular/angular/commits/850390174677216eb9c85120b1e44386421f53ed/comments","author":{"login":"gkalpak","id":8604205,"node_id":"MDQ6VXNlcjg2MDQyMDU=","avatar_url":"https://avatars2.githubusercontent.com/u/8604205?v=4","gravatar_id":"","url":"https://api.github.com/users/gkalpak","html_url":"https://github.com/gkalpak","followers_url":"https://api.github.com/users/gkalpak/followers","following_url":"https://api.github.com/users/gkalpak/following{/other_user}","gists_url":"https://api.github.com/users/gkalpak/gists{/gist_id}","starred_url":"https://api.github.com/users/gkalpak/starred{/owner}{/repo}","subscriptions_url":"https://api.github.com/users/gkalpak/subscriptions","organizations_url":"https://api.github.com/users/gkalpak/orgs","repos_url":"https://api.github.com/users/gkalpak/repos","events_url":"https://api.github.com/users/gkalpak/events{/privacy}","received_events_url":"https://api.github.com/users/gkalpak/received_events","type":"User","site_admin":false},"committer":{"login":"kara","id":3871688,"node_id":"MDQ6VXNlcjM4NzE2ODg=","avatar_url":"https://avatars3.githubusercontent.com/u/3871688?v=4","gravatar_id":"","url":"https://api.github.com/users/kara","html_url":"https://github.com/kara","followers_url":"https://api.github.com/users/kara/followers","following_url":"https://api.github.com/users/kara/following{/other_user}","gists_url":"https://api.github.com/users/kara/gists{/gist_id}","starred_url":"https://api.github.com/users/kara/starred{/owner}{/repo}","subscriptions_url":"https://api.github.com/users/kara/subscriptions","organizations_url":"https://api.github.com/users/kara/orgs","repos_url":"https://api.github.com/users/kara/repos","events_url":"https://api.github.com/users/kara/events{/privacy}","received_events_url":"https://api.github.com/users/kara/received_events","type":"User","site_admin":false},"parents":[{"sha":"e01d697eedbc3dd3eeba07873a6d9c08121fb0c6","url":"https://api.github.com/repos/angular/angular/commits/e01d697eedbc3dd3eeba07873a6d9c08121fb0c6","html_url":"https://github.com/angular/angular/commit/e01d697eedbc3dd3eeba07873a6d9c08121fb0c6"}]},{"sha":"e01d697eedbc3dd3eeba07873a6d9c08121fb0c6","node_id":"MDY6Q29tbWl0MjQxOTUzMzk6ZTAxZDY5N2VlZGJjM2RkM2VlYmEwNzg3M2E2ZDljMDgxMjFmYjBjNg==","commit":{"author":{"name":"Paul Gschwendtner","email":"paulgschwendtner@gmail.com","date":"2019-06-26T16:17:07Z"},"committer":{"name":"Kara Erickson","email":"karakara@google.com","date":"2019-06-26T16:23:02Z"},"message":"build: filter out changelog entries for zone.js from framework changelog (#31277)\n\nWe don't want to show entries for the `zone.js` scope in the main framework\nchangelog file.

Since user code can throw errors, calls to\nit are frequently wrapped in a try-finally block. In Ivy, the following\npattern is common:\n\n```typescript\nenterView();\ntry {\n  callUserCode();\n} finally {\n  leaveView();\n}\n```\n\nThis has a significant problem, however: `leaveView` has a side effect: it\ncalls any pending lifecycle hooks that might've been scheduled during the\ncurrent round of change detection. Generally it's a bad idea to run\nlifecycle hooks after the application has crashed. The application is in an\ninconsistent state - directives may not be instantiated fully, queries may\nnot be resolved, bindings may not have been applied, etc. Invariants that\nthe app code relies upon may not hold. Further crashes or broken behavior\nare likely.\n\nFrequently, lifecycle hooks are used to make assertions about these\ninvariants. When these assertions fail, they will throw and \"swallow\" the\noriginal error, making debugging of the problem much more difficult.\n\nThis commit modifies `leaveView` to understand whether the application is\ncurrently crashing, via a parameter `safeToRunHooks`. This parameter is set\nby modifying the above pattern:\n\n```typescript\nenterView();\nlet safeToRunHooks = false;\ntry {\n  callUserCode();\n  safeToRunHooks = true;\n} finally {\n  leaveView(..., safeToRunHooks);\n}\n```\n\nIf `callUserCode` crashes, then `safeToRunHooks` will never be set to `true`\nand `leaveView` won't call any further user code. The original error will\nthen propagate back up the stack and be reported correctly. A test is added\nto verify this behavior.\n\nPR Close #31244","tree":{"sha":"c8ad156000454841bf90e2e3669a131bf13e312c","url":"https://api.github.com/repos/angular/angular/git/trees/c8ad156000454841bf90e2e3669a131bf13e312c"},"url":"https://api.github.com/repos/angular/angular/git/commits/32c760f5e7bb13356d1a0319687d2afc4537dc0f","comment_count":0,"verification":{"verified":false,"reason":"unsigned","signature":null,"payload":null}},"url":"https://api.github.com/repos/angular/angular/commits/32c760f5e7bb13356d1a0319687d2afc4537dc0f","html_url":"https://github.com/angular/angular/commit/32c760f5e7bb13356d1a0319687d2afc4537dc0f","comments_url":"https://api.github.com/repos/angular/angular/commits/32c760f5e7bb13356d1a0319687d2afc4537dc0f/comments","author":{"login":"alxhub","id":4175141,"node_id":"MDQ6VXNlcjQxNzUxNDE=","avatar_url":"https://avatars0.githubusercontent.com/u/4175141?v=4","gravatar_id":"","url":"https://api.github.com/users/alxhub","html_url":"https://github.com/alxhub","followers_url":"https://api.github.com/users/alxhub/followers","following_url":"https://api.github.com/users/alxhub/following{/other_user}","gists_url":"https://api.github.com/users/alxhub/gists{/gist_id}","starred_url":"https://api.github.com/users/alxhub/starred{/owner}{/repo}","subscriptions_url":"https://api.github.com/users/alxhub/subscriptions","organizations_url":"https://api.github.com/users/alxhub/orgs","repos_url":"https://api.github.com/users/alxhub/repos","events_url":"https://api.github.com/users/alxhub/events{/privacy}","received_events_url":"https://api.github.com/users/alxhub/received_events","type":"User","site_admin":false},"committer":{"login":"kara","id":3871688,"node_id":"MDQ6VXNlcjM4NzE2ODg=","avatar_url":"https://avatars3.githubusercontent.com/u/3871688?v=4","gravatar_id":"","url":"https://api.github.com/users/kara","html_url":"https://github.com/kara","followers_url":"https://api.github.com/users/kara/followers","following_url":"https://api.github.com/users/kara/following{/other_user}","gists_url":"https://api.github.com/users/kara/gists{/gist_id}","starred_url":"https://api.github.com/users/kara/starred{/owner}{/repo}","subscriptions_url":"https://api.github.com/users/kara/subscriptions","organizations_url":"https://api.github.com/users/kara/orgs","repos_url":"https://api.github.com/users/kara/repos","events_url":"https://api.github.com/users/kara/events{/privacy}","received_events_url":"https://api.github.com/users/kara/received_events","type":"User","site_admin":false},"parents":[{"sha":"f690a4e0af6073714e50cb4586a0c260676e13e0","url":"https://api.github.com/repos/angular/angular/commits/f690a4e0af6073714e50cb4586a0c260676e13e0","html_url":"https://github.com/angular/angular/commit/f690a4e0af6073714e50cb4586a0c260676e13e0"}]},{"sha":"f690a4e0af6073714e50cb4586a0c260676e13e0","node_id":"MDY6Q29tbWl0MjQxOTUzMzk6ZjY5MGE0ZTBhZjYwNzM3MTRlNTBjYjQ1ODZhMGMyNjA2NzZlMTNlMA==","commit":{"author":{"name":"Pete Bacon Darwin","email":"pete@bacondarwin.com","date":"2019-05-25T20:34:40Z"},"committer":{"name":"Kara Erickson","email":"karakara@google.com","date":"2019-06-26T15:00:03Z"},"message":"fix(ivy): ngcc - do not analyze files outside the current package (#30591)\n\nOur module resolution prefers `.js` files over `.d.ts` files because\noccasionally libraries publish their typings in the same directory\nstructure as the compiled JS files, i.e. adjacent to each other.\n\nThe standard TS module resolution would pick up the typings\nfile and add that to the `ts.Program` and so they would be\nignored by our analyzers.

Summary ##\r\nSince Angular 6 there have been 2 fundamentally different ways of configuring services for injection but these 2 approaches don't interact well with one another which can result in confusing application bugs, and I don't think the implications of the 2 different approaches have been made sufficiently clear in the documentation.\r\n\r\n## Caveat ##\r\nI'm not really sure of the best way to categorise this issue. I think documentation improvements could help users to handle this better, but it really seems to me to be more of a design flaw in the service injection framework. From a coding perspective, I'm not really sure what could be done to improve it, but there may well be a good solution that I've been unable to think of.\r\n\r\nMuch of this problem has already been touched on by a couple of other github issues:\r\n- https://github.com/angular/angular-cli/issues/10170\r\n- https://github.com/angular/angular/issues/25784\r\n\r\n## The Current Situation ##\r\nPrior to Angular 6, services were generally configured for injection by decorating the service's containing NgModule as follows:\r\n```\r\n@NgModule({\r\n    providers: [MyService]\r\n})\r\nexport class MyServiceModule {\r\n```\r\nBut since Angular 6, users have been encouraged to configure services as follows instead:\r\n```\r\n@Injectable({\r\n    providedIn: 'root'\r\n})\r\nexport class MyService {\r\n```\r\n\r\nThe new approach has 2 advantages, namely:\r\n1.  It enables tree-shaking of unused services - since they no longer have to be included in the `providers` array of an NgModule.\r\n2.  It ensures that only one instance of the service will ever exist - _even if the service is consumed by multiple, lazy-loaded modules_\r\n\r\nI think it's worth noting however, that:\r\n1.  Tree-shaking of services is only really necessary when writing a third party library. When writing an _application_ it is pretty unlikely that you would include - except perhaps by accident - a service which you weren't intending to use somewhere.\r\n2.  Service duplication can be avoided anyway by taking appropriate care when lazy-loading modules - although the new approach _is_ safer in this respect.\r\n\r\nThe new approach also has one very important implication though, which I don't think is made sufficiently clear in the documentation, and which in turn can lead to confusing dependency issues when both approaches are used within the same application (or across different libraries which are consumed by that application):\r\n\r\n## Service \"Ownership\" ##\r\nIf `MyService` is configured for injection using the `@NgModule` `providers` decoration, the service can rightly be considered to \"belong\" to that NgModule. It is also therefore that module's responsibility to make sure that it imports any other NgModules which provide services that `MyService` depends on.\r\n\r\nIf `MyService` is configured using the `@Injectable`, `providedIn: 'root'` syntax though, the service no longer really \"belongs\" anywhere. It might be co-located with a particular NgModule on the file system, but it has no relationship to it - it doesn't know about the module, and the module doesn't know about the service. This may not be immediately obvious to developers.\r\n\r\nBecause there is no longer an \"owning\" NgModule, the `MyService` class will now just be bundled with whatever consumes it, and it is then the _consumer's_ responsibility to ensure that the service's dependencies - i.e. any services which are injected into it - are available. This is fine if all _those_ services have also been configured with `providedIn: 'root'` (and also all of _their_ dependencies, etc.). It becomes more complicated though, in a scenario where interdependencies exist between services that have been configured in different ways - as can easily happen when using third party libraries, or even when consuming built-in Angular services that have been configured via the old-style `providers` array.\r\n\r\n## Problem Example ###\r\nConsider the following scenario:\r\n\r\n1.  `MyComponent` is in `MyComponentModule` and consumes `MyService` which has been decorated with `providedIn: 'root'`. `MyService` is \"in\" (but not really - it is just co-located with) `MyServiceModule`.\r\n2.  `MyService` consumes `ThirdPartyService` _which hasn't been similarly decorated_. Instead, `ThirdPartyService` has been provided via the `providers` array in `ThirdPartyServiceModule`.\r\n3. `MyServiceModule` imports `ThirdPartyServiceModule`, but as it turns out this is incidental, because _`MyService` doesn't really belong to `MyServiceModule`_\r\n\r\nThe code fails at run time, when it attempts to instantiate `MyService` for injection into `MyComponent` with:\r\n```\r\nNullInjectorError: No provider for ThirdPartyService!\r\n```\r\n\r\nThis is because `MyComponentModule` has not imported `ThirdPartyServiceModule`, but this is not very obvious to the developer. It doesn't seem very logical (to me anyway) that `MyComponentModule` should have to care about `MyService`'s dependencies (or perhaps even its dependencies' dependencies), just because of the different ways in which these services have been configured.\r\n\r\nAs I say, I don't really know what the best way is to fix this - apart from perhaps making the implications of all this a little clearer in the documentation. The cat is now somewhat out of the bag regarding the (now not-so-)new `providedIn: 'root'` syntax and at the moment I can't think of a way to make these 2 different approaches play nicely with each other."},{"url":"https://api.github.com/repos/angular/angular/issues/31308","repository_url":"https://api.github.com/repos/angular/angular","labels_url":"https://api.github.com/repos/angular/angular/issues/31308/labels{/name}","comments_url":"https://api.github.com/repos/angular/angular/issues/31308/comments","events_url":"https://api.github.com/repos/angular/angular/issues/31308/events","html_url":"https://github.com/angular/angular/pull/31308","id":461445762,"node_id":"MDExOlB1bGxSZXF1ZXN0MjkyMzY2MDM0","number":31308,"title":"build(docs-infra):

and I recently discussed how best to implement indexing templates in the [`Ngtsc` indexing module](./packages/compiler-cli/src/ngtsc/indexer). I'm dumping the key points of that discussion here for future reference and discussion.\r\n\r\n# 🚀 feature request\r\n\r\n### Relevant Package\r\n\r\nFor @angular/compiler-cli, `Ngtsc` indexer module.\r\n\r\n### Description\r\n\r\nThe compiler's indexing module does not currently support indexing HTML elements in templates. We want to add support for that. Initially, the scope of this was\r\n\r\n- Record element selectors used in the template\r\n- Record used directives in the template\r\n\r\nsuch that an indexer could link an element selector to the directive it references, if any. This approach is quite limiting, however, because directive selectors can match on many things beside element selectors, including matching on attributes and implicitly matching on the absence of an attribute. A better approach is\r\n\r\n- Record element selectors used in the template\r\n  - each selector record also includes a record of attributes on the element\r\n  - each selector record also includes a record of used directives on the element\r\n\r\nTo consider the usefulness of this, consider a template like `<my-comp applied-dir>` that uses the directives `MyComp`, `AppliedDir`, and an implicitly loaded directive `ImplicitDir`. The compiler's indexer module will index the template and record an element identifier that looks something like\r\n\r\n```typescript\r\n{\r\n  name: 'my-comp',\r\n  span: ...,\r\n  attributes: [ { name: 'applied-dir', span: ... } ],\r\n  usedDirectives: [ MyComp, AppliedDir, ImplicitDir ],\r\n}\r\n```\r\n\r\nA source code indexer implementation can then use this information to generate useful references, like xreferencing `my-comp` to the `MyComp` class declaration, `applied-dir` to the `AppliedDir` class declaration, and adding an implicit reference of all three used directives on `my-comp`.\r\n\r\n### Alternatives\r\n\r\n- Do not record attributes separately; pass the entire element tag source code as the element identifier name instead.\r\n  - __advantages__: less work for the compiler's indexing module.\r\n  - __disadvantages__: an indexer implementation now has to write an HTML parser to discern attributes on the element.\r\n- Perform the linking of attributes to the directives that match it in the compiler.\r\n  - __advantages__: less work for an indexer implementation\r\n  - __disadvantages__: directives are applied to an element, not an attribute, so such an implementation would be needlessly complicated. Furthermore, it is not necessarily the job of the compiler's semantic analysis API to make decisions about what spans of text reference one another, especially in ambiguous cases like the one presented here - that should be on the indexer implementation."},{"url":"https://api.github.com/repos/angular/angular/issues/31298","repository_url":"https://api.github.com/repos/angular/angular","labels_url":"https://api.github.com/repos/angular/angular/issues/31298/labels{/name}","comments_url":"https://api.github.com/repos/angular/angular/issues/31298/comments","events_url":"https://api.github.com/repos/angular/angular/issues/31298/events","html_url":"https://github.com/angular/angular/pull/31298","id":461139885,"node_id":"MDExOlB1bGxSZXF1ZXN0MjkyMTI1NDU0","number":31298,"title":"docs:
